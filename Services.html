    <p>PriceWaterhouseCoopers Acceleration Center Manila offers wide range services which includes:</p>
    <br>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Audit and Assurance</button>
    <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Virtual CFO</b></li>
        <p>- In the period of crisis, credible and timely financial reporting will help you make sound decisions to bring your business back on track. 
          Virtual CFOs will provide valuable insights in both the internal operations and 
          external market conditions that can be useful in making management decisions to enhance financial performance of the company.</p>
          <br>
        <li><b>Virtual Internal Audit</b></li>
        <p>- Changes to working practices in response to COVID-19 introduce a range of new or enhanced risk areas,
           and the potential to disrupt the existing system of internal controls is high. 
           It has heightened the need for Internal Audit functions to be agile to better enable continuity of service through remote working.
            This minimizes the adverse impact and maximizes the value of internal audit activity for management and the Board.</p>
          <br>
        <li><b>Board Box</b></li>
        <p>- When most organizations are increasingly being prevented from offering in-person internship experience, 
          Isla Lipana & Co. (PwC Philippines) continues to invest in our future Filipino CPAs.
           At PwC, they recognize the value that this program can offer to change the trajectory of their professional career.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>CyberSecurity</b></li>
        <p>- As companies pivot toward a digital business model, exponentially more data is generated and shared among organizations, partners and customers. 
          This digital information has become the lifeblood of the interconnected business ecosystem and is increasingly valuable to organizations—and to skilled threat actors. 
          Business digitization also has exposed companies to new digital vulnerabilities, making effective cybersecurity and privacy more important than ever. 
          PwC offers services that address challenges which relate to cybersecurity and privacy threats, organizational changes, and regulatory requirements for organizations.</p>

          <li><b>Data Protection & Privacy</b></li>

        <br>
          <li><b>IT Risk and Compliance</b></li>
        <p>- Emerging technologies and the increased digitization efforts of organizations also increased the expectation for internal audit and compliance functions to provide value and insights to the business. With their compliance services, 
          you can have the confidence that the technologies you choose are meeting regulatory and compliance requirements and mitigating any security risks.</p>
        <br>
          <li><b>Trust & Transparency</b></li>

          Information they can trust. In line with international standards, they help organizations respond to demands for increased transparency and industry comparability, and increase the credibility of that reporting.</p>
